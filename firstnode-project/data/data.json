The avocado is popular in vegetarian cuisine as a  substitute for meat in sandwich and salads because of its high fat content. Generally, avocado is served raw, though some cultivar, including the commom 'Hass', can be cooked for a short time without becoming bitter. It is used as the base for the Mexican dip known as guacamole, as well as a spread on corn tortillas or toast, served with spices."
